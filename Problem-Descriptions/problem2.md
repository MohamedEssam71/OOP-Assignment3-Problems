# Nim Game Variants

This project implements two different variants of the Nim game using recursion and backtracking. The goal is to develop a computer player that can play these game variants.

## Game Variants

### Variant One: Even Pile Nim

In the simple Nim game, the player who takes the last coin loses, and the coins taken by players are ignored. In this variant, each player has their own pile of coins. The player whose pile contains an even number of coins after the last move wins the game.

### Variant Two: Three-Pile Nim

In the simple Nim game, all the coins are placed in one pile. In this variant, the coins are divided into three piles as shown in the picture. Each player can take 1, 2, or 3 coins from any pile they choose. The player who takes the last coin loses the game.

## Implementation

The implementation of these game variants can be done using object-oriented programming (OOP) techniques. It is recommended to create a parent abstract class that defines the required behavior of the game, and then create child classes to represent the different variants.

## Usage

To play the Nim game variants, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your/repository.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd nim-game-variants`
3. Compile and run the program: `python nim_game.py`
4. Follow the on-screen instructions to play the game.
