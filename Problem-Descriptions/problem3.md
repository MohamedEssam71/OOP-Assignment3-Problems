# Enhanced Maze Solving Problem

This project enhances the maze solving problem by adding new features to the existing code. The goal is to help the mouse navigate through the maze and find the shortest path while avoiding infinite recursion and providing multiple solutions if available.

## Features

The enhanced maze solving problem includes the following features:

1. **Movement in Any Direction:** The mouse is allowed to move in any of the four directions - up, down, right, and left. This enables more flexibility in finding the solution.

2. **Avoiding Circular Paths:** The program ensures that the mouse does not go in circles and avoids revisiting the same point in the path. This prevents infinite recursion and ensures the program terminates successfully.

3. **Multiple Solutions:** A new function is added to return all possible solutions if multiple solutions are available. This allows for exploring different paths and finding alternative solutions.

4. **Shortest Solution:** Another function is added to return the shortest solution if multiple solutions exist. This helps in finding the most efficient path to solve the maze.

## Usage

To use the enhanced maze solving program, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your/repository.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd maze-solving-enhancement`
3. Compile and run the program: `python maze_solver.py`
4. Follow the on-screen instructions to input the maze and view the solution.
