# Frequency Table Generator

This program generates a frequency table for a text file, which lists words and the number of times each word appears in the document. The program utilizes the STL Map data structure to store key-value pairs of string and int.

## Problem Description

Farah Mohamed, while working with a foreign company on a search engine project, needs to order retrieved documents based on the frequency of words. To accomplish this, she requires a frequency table that counts the occurrences of each word in a given text file.

The program performs the following steps:

1. Reads the input file specified by the user.
2. Cleans the text file by removing all punctuation and non-alphanumeric characters (except "-").
3. Builds a frequency table using the cleaned words.
4. Displays the generated frequency table.

## Usage

To use the frequency table generator program, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your/repository.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd frequency-table-generator`
3. Compile and run the program: `./frequency_table_generator`
4. Enter the name of the text file to analyze.
5. View the generated frequency table.

## Requirements

This program requires a C++ compiler that supports the C++11 standard and the STL library.
